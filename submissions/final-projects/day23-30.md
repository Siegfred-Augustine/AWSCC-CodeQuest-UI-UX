Practice may not mean perfect but practice is still progress!

During my time with this project, I've learned about countless things, It also really helped me express my creativity. I know that everything I've learned here would help me in the path I will take. 

I would like to thank everyone here at **AWSCC** for giving me a chance to experience all of this!
