I was once someone who would only try to ace something for the first try. No plans, no outline, just finishing a task as quickly as I possibly can.It never occured to me to make prototypes of something because I thought that I never needed to. Designing a website is a first for me. I just quickly went ahead and skipped other steps enitrely. I can't really nail it on the first try no matter how hard I try. I always end up not satisfied with how it looks. But then, I tried to make a low-fidelity wireframe. It turns out, it is much more easier and efficient. I had fun making this and I am actually excited to try and make this plan into fruition.
