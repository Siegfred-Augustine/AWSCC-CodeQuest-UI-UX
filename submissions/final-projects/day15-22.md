Actually making your plans into reality is honestly really hard. You still have to make a lo tof changes along the way. This was a chance for myself to express my **creativity** and it really opened my eyes to the world of UI/UX designing. 

All in all, I still liked how the project turned out and this whole experience really helped me a lot! ðŸ’–
